## Overview

The default view of the application. The blue circles are just recorded clicks, to show some functionality.

Hovering over it reveals four buttons that perform the following:

Location | Symbol | Purpose
:---: | :---: | ---
â†–|`â›¶`|Expands the program to be fullscreen with blur
â†—|`âˆž`|Menu with various views based on your taste
â†™|`â‰¡`|Opens the playlist view, public and private
â†˜|`â™¡`|Likes a song, adding it to your favorite tracks

There are other features in play, with a number more planned! I work on this during the weekends, but you're also welcome to submit feature or pull requests at any point.

## Installation

 #### Windows Users
>
> Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/novatorem/Melodify/releases) page and download the latest release

Currently only supports Windows 10, planning on further expansion if this picks up.

## Development setup

Developed on Visual Studio 2019 - a WPF application using .NET

You'll need to get your own Spotify API and YouTube API access.
Set up a Resources.resx file under the Solution Properties.
You'll then need three variables, with their respective keys:
- SpotID
- SpotSecret
- YoutubeAPI

## Known Issues

- Running as an admin breaks the music video feature

## Various Views

Just to give an idea on what it generally looks like, the miniature view blurs and darkens the album art and uses it as the background as such:
